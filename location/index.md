## How to reach the venue
From Bergamo airport (Milan-Bergamo Airport - Orio al Serio - BGY)
Take BUS Line 1 / airport to Porta S. Agostino stop.

### From Linate airport (LIN)
From Linate airport you can take the metro to the railway station (Centrale or Lambrate), and then the train to Bergamo. Alternatively, from Linate airport, you can take the blue line (Metro 4) to the Milano Forlanini station, then the train to Pioltello Limito and, finally, the train to Bergamo.

### From Malpensa airport (MXP)
From Malpensa airport you can reach the railway Central Station of Milan by bus (1h journey, every 10 minutes), operated by Autostradale and Malpensashuttle. There is also a train running from MXP and Milano Centrale (or Milano Cadorna, but then you need to take the metro). The train is faster than the bus, but be careful to take the right direction to Milano Centrale. Then, from the Central Station of Milan, you can take the train to Bergamo. The ticket for the train is €6,00.

### By Car
We do not recommend reaching the venue by car, as the entire Città Alta area is a Limited Traffic Zone (only selected vehicles, e.g., residents, can access that area) and parking is limited. The Limited Traffic Zone is active on Sunday between 10:00 and 12:00, and between 14:00 and 19:00, while the other days it is active between 21:00 and 01:00.

You can find the map of all areas involved in the Limited Traffic Zone, as well as the map of all the cameras surveilling the entries and the activation times, here (unfortunately, only available in Italian).

If you wish to park in Città Alta, there is a new parking very close to the conference venue, and you can access the Limited Traffic Zone if you park there. It costs 3,50 €/h.
