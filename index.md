TAROT (Training And Research On Testing) is a network created to foster the mobility of students, faculty members and research scientists working in the field of testing of software and communication systems. This summer school brings together lecturers, researchers, students and people from the industry across Europe for one week of presentations, discussions and getting to know each other.

The main goal of the TAROT Summer School is to give researchers and particularly Ph.D. students the opportunity to follow a number of tutorials or invited talks by key experts in the field. The TAROT Summer School is open to researchers from any institution in the world, working in the area of testing, both from academia and industry.
